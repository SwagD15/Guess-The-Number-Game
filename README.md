*Guess The Number Game*

The Number Guessing Game is a simple console application written in C that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number. Utilizing the `rand()` function from the standard library, the program generates a random number within a specified range, typically between 1 and 100. 

Players are prompted to enter their guesses, and the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the number, and the total number of attempts is displayed at the end. This project showcases basic concepts of C programming, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
